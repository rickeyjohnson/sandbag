# Sandbag

**Sandbag** is a modern Spades scoring companion app that makes playing with friends simple and stress-free. Create a game room, invite your crew with a unique code, and let Sandbag handle the tracking. Each player submits their bids privately, results are entered after every real-life round, and the app automatically calculates scores, bags, and team standings. No more arguments, no more math â€” just smooth, real-time scorekeeping for the game you love

## Key Features

  * **Real-time Scoring:** The app automatically calculates scores, bags, and team standings after every round, eliminating manual math and potential arguments.
  * **Private Bids:** Each player submits their bids privately in the app, preventing other players from seeing their call and keeping the bidding honest.
  * **Simple Room Creation:** Easily create a game room and invite your friends with a unique, shareable code.
  * **Team Standings:** Keep a real-time eye on which team is in the lead with clear and automatically updated standings.
  * **History & Stats (Coming Soon):** We're working on features to track game history, personal stats, and other insights to help you get better at the game.
