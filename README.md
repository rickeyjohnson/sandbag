# Sandbag

**Sandbag** is a modern Spades scoring companion app that makes playing with friends simple and stress-free. Create a game room, invite your crew with a unique code, and let Sandbag handle the tracking. Each player submits their bids privately, results are entered after every real-life round, and the app automatically calculates scores, bags, and team standings. No more arguments, no more math â€” just smooth, real-time scorekeeping for the game you love
